# BoW3D
BoW3D is developed for the real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM. It builds the bag of words for the **LinK3D Feature** (**[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05927.pdf)**), which is an efficient and robust 3D LiDAR point cloud feature. BoW3D is able to detect loops and correct the full 6-DoF loop relative pose for the subsequent pose graph optimization in real time. It also can be used to relocalize the 3D LiDAR in real time. We provide an example to run BoW3D on the [KITTI dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php). For more details about BoW3D, please refer to our paper **"BoW3D: Bag of Words for Real-Time Loop Closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM"** in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) (**[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07473.pdf)**).

Fig1. The hash table is used as the overall data structure. The word of BoW3D consists of the non-zero value (Dim-value) in the descriptor and the corresponding dimension (Dim-ID). Each word corresponds to a place set, in which the word has appeared. The place also consists of two parts, one is frame ID, the other is the descriptor ID in the frame.

## 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in Ubuntu 16.04, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A computer with an Intel Core i7 will ensure the real-time performance and provide stable and accurate results.
 
- [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- [PCL(>=1.7)](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl)
- [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
- [Eigen 3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/)

## 3. Compile and run the package
Before compile the package, in the main function of Example.cpp file, you should replace the dataset path with the file path in your computer. 

    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/YungeCui/BoW3D/
    cd ..
    catkin_make -j8
    source devel/setup.bash
    rosrun BoW3D bow3d
